Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Layan Almarzougi, a passionate Saudi game developer fueled by creativity and a love for immersive experiences. 
I started getting into game making back in university. It was like I found the perfect way to use all my creative energy! 
I wanted to learn more, so I joined a game development bootcamp. That's where I got to really dive into game design and sharpen my skills.

â€‹
Ever since then, it's been an exciting journey for me. I've been exploring all the cool things you can do in game development.
Whether it's making tricky puzzles or creating awesome worlds, every project is a chance for me to try something new and make something unforgettable.

I'm always up for learning new stuff. Whether it's trying out the latest tech or keeping up with what's happening in the game world, I'm all in.
